## Visualizations and Their Brief Introduction
#### Estimated Nuclear Inventories: Deployed strategic inventories are mounted on long-range delivery systems such as ICBMs and submarines and are ready to use within minutes. The deployed non-strategic are mounted on short-range delivery systems. Although current numbers are significantly lower than the peak of  60,000 in the 1980s, even a fraction of these stockpiles is enough to have a long-term impact on humanity
#### Country positions on TPNW: As of 2025, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States did not participate in negotiations and did not vote for its adoption. India, Pakistan, and Israel never joined the treaty, and North Korea withdrew in 2003
#### Historical Close Calls: Those incidents during which nuclear powers came close to using their assets, either accidentally or deliberately. The complete list is never known, but reading the publicly available instances, it's not hard to see that all it takes is one misfire, one glitch, or small miscommunication for a nuclear asset to be deployed and trigger a response
#### Doomsday Clock: The Doomsday Clock is a metaphor representing how close humanity is to an existential threat with technologies of our own making. Created in 1947, it only represented the danger of nuclear weapons, but the current parameters also include risks from climate change, diseases, and AI (yes, AI!). On Jan 28, 2025, the clock moved to 89 seconds to midnight—the closest it has ever been, signalling an unprecedented risk
#### Billion dollars: $91.40 billion was spent by nine nuclear states in developing their already well-stocked inventory. At $2,898 per second, this sum could have been redirected to Education, Clean Water, Disease prevention, Housing or Climate change initiatives 
#### Overpressure: An overpressure of 5 psi is enough to destroy most residential buildings. 
#### Temperature: For reference, the Sun’s core temperature is 15 million degrees
#### Global ozone loss: Soot produced after a nuclear event would collapse the ozone layer, leading to a tropical index above 35. For reference, a UV index of 11 is considered to pose extreme danger for humans.
#### Famine Risk – With a global collapse of the food supply chain and skyrocketing prices, even those who endure the initial impact may struggle to survive

In the last month, I have seen two movies, Don’t Look Up and The Day After-1983 (available on YouTube). One is hilarious, the other, striking. Yet, both share a common theme. When it comes to worst-case scenarios, it's the common civilians who ultimately take the hit (job losses, seeing their life savings wiped out in days, or being pushed into conflicts no one asked for). It's imperative more than ever for us to be able to access independent/uninfluenced media to make informed voting decisions. Because if a life-altering event were to occur on Planet Earth, no one would be untouched. Except, perhaps, for our leaders—comfortably settled in tailored suits on colonized Mars—plotting tariffs and awaiting their ‘thank yous.’
